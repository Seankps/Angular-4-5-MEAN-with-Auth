This is an Angular 4 MEAN stack app with user registration and authentication. I will flesh out the readme more shortly

# Guidance from:
- [Setting up MEAN with Angular 4+](https://coursetro.com/posts/code/84/Setting-up-an-Angular-4-MEAN-Stack-(Tutorial))  ( [GitHub](https://github.com/designcourse/mean4plus) )
- [Basic User-Auth with Mongo, Node, Express](https://medium.com/of-all-things-tech-progress/starting-with-authentication-a-tutorial-with-node-js-and-mongodb-25d524ca0359)  { [GitHub](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/authenticationIntro) )
- [Auth Guards](https://scotch.io/tutorials/protecting-angular-v2-routes-with-canactivatecanactivatechild-guards) 

# TO DOs

- upgrade all NPM remaining besides angular
- figure out upgrade issues with mongoose/mongo post-updates, likely opneURI based
- better error handling
- switch node/express session to JWT
